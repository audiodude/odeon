A player may elect to change their status from "Active" to "Passing" in the case he or she will not be able to contribute to votes or propose new rules. 
Passing a vote is neither an automatic for or against vote, meaning that a minimum of three active players must be in the game at any one time. 

To indicate a state of passing, update your player file with your score "+{status}", e.g. 14+passing. No status message indicates active. 

This rule overrides rule 201's disallowing of passed turns. Pull requests to update your state follow the same rules as updating a player's score as per rule 306.
