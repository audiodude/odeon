A player may elect to change his or her status from "Active" to "Passing" in the case he or she will not be able to contribute to votes or propose new rules. 
Passing a vote is neither an automatic for or against vote, meaning that a minimum of three active players must be in the game at any one time. 

If there are less than three active players, voting cannot commence and the game is essentially paused until a third player becomes active. 

To indicate a state of passing, update your player file with your score "+{status}", e.g. 14+passing. No status message indicates active. It is acceptable for a player's pull request to signify the start of their passing session. This pull request can be auto-merged as to not allow rejection of a player's wish to be passing. 

This rule overrides rule 201's disallowing of passed turns. Pull requests to update your state follow the same rules as updating a player's score as per rule 306.
